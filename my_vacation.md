# My vacation

## 1. About a summer vacation



## 2. Where have I been



## 3. My grandfather's garden



## 4. A new knowledge



## 5. An incredible experience

Just like mornings, evenings have also been wonderful. I used to keep my head on my grandmaâ€™s lap and she used to tell me several interesting stories. We used to sleep on the terrace, gazing sparkling and beautiful stars all night. Sleeping under the infinite blue sky while enjoying the cool breeze was an incredible experience for me. It is not possible to get such kind of experience in the city.
