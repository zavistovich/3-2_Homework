## 1. About a summer vacation



## 2. Where have I been

On my vacation, I went to my grandparentsâ€™ place and spent the rest of the vacation there. They stay in a village that is at a five-hour distance by train via village settings. This place is away from the hustle bustle of the city. It is full of natural beauty. The air is fresh and clean. The entire environment is extremely relaxing. As soon as I step into the village atmosphere, I feel so much comfort and at home. 

* The best part is that my cousins also visited the native place at that time. 
* We have planned to play outdoor activities throughout the day. I spent fifteen days there. 

I have been very well-behaved and courteous.
